This repository contains a clone of YouTube
home page, created by me using HTML and CSS
through the guidance of youtube and google 
along with countless trial and run method.
This is my first Project, meant to prepare 
me for creating my portfolio from the very
basic and expend my knowledge.

I hosted this HTML page into online mode 
twice, by using Netlify through manual 
deploy and import from Gitbub for practice.
